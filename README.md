# Purpose
A baseline repo to practice a series of increasingly difficult PyTorch exercises.

# PyTorch
PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is widely used for applications in deep learning, a subset of machine learning where neural networks—models inspired by the human brain—learn from large amounts of data. PyTorch is known for its ease of use, efficiency, and dynamic computational graph that allows flexibility in machine learning model design. It is predominantly used with Python and is popular in both academic research and industry applications. PyTorch's intuitive design and strong community support make it suitable for both beginners and advanced users. It is used in various fields ranging from computer vision to natural language processing.

# Supported GPUs
PyTorch's GPU support includes a variety of hardware:

  * NVIDIA: PyTorch fully supports NVIDIA GPUs via the CUDA toolkit, which provides highly optimized performance for deep learning models and large datasets.

  * Intel: While PyTorch can run on Intel CPUs, GPU support via Intel's hardware (like the oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library or oneDNN) is less optimized compared to NVIDIA.

  * AMD: PyTorch support for AMD GPUs is growing, particularly through the ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) platform, though it might not be as extensive as NVIDIA's CUDA support.

  * Mac GPUs: PyTorch supports GPU acceleration on Mac systems with Apple Silicon (such as the M1 and later models) through the "Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend for PyTorch." This integration allows efficient utilization of Apple's Metal technology, enhancing performance over CPU-only execution. Users need a compatible PyTorch version and systems meeting Metal Performance Shaders requirements, with details available on PyTorch's official website or GitHub repository.

**When working with PyTorch, it's essential to consider the compatibility and performance optimization with the specific hardware and software stack being used.**
